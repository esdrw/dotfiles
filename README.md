### home directory

Contains `.tmux.conf` and `cmd_help`. Note that `.tmux.conf` includes plugins, which will have to be installed before the configuration will work as intended. The latter is a (probably incomplete) cheat sheet with a few reminders about my less frequently used commands and shortcuts.

### nvim directory

The contents go in the `~/.conf/nvim` directory. Install the plugins with `vim-plug`.
